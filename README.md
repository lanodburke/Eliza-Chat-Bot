This is my implementation of the Eliza chat bot written in golang. 
ELIZA is a computer program that emulates a Rogerian psychotherapist.
It is an early example of a natural language processing computer program, it was created in 1964 to 1966 at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum.
ELIZA has almost no intelligence whatsoever, only tricks like string substitution and canned responses based on keywords. Yet when the original ELIZA first appeared in the 60's, some people actually mistook her for human. The illusion of intelligence works best, however, if you limit your conversation to talking about yourself and your life.
I decided to theme the chatbot based on the popular TV show Rick and Morty.

How to run the program: 
```
git clone https://github.com/lanodburke/Eliza-Chat-Bot.git
cd Eliza-Chat-Bot
go build eliza.go
eliza.exe
```
Then in your browser url search bar type:
```
localhost:8080
```
Enter your question in the "Type your message" input field to get a response from Eliza.
